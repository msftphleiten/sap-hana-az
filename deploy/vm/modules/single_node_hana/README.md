## Usage

1. If you haven't already done so, please make sure you [prepare your Azure Cloud Shell](https://github.com/Azure/sap-hana#preparing-your-azure-cloud-shell).

2. Next, [download the required SAP packages and make them accessible](https://github.com/Azure/sap-hana#getting-the-sap-packages).

 *(**Note**: Please review the [list of SAP downloads](https://github.com/Azure/sap-hana#required-sap-downloads); depending on which features and applications you would like to include in your HANA installation, you may need additional packages.)*

3. In your Azure Cloud Shell, change into the directory for the HANA single-node scenario:

    ```sh
    cd sap-hana/deploy/vm/modules/single_node_hana/

4. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file for your deployment. You can use the provided [Boilerplate template ](terraform.tfvars.template) for single-node scenarios as a starting point and adjust the variables according to your requirements.

 *(**Note**: You need to rename the boilerplate template from `terraform.tfvars.template` to `terraform.tfvars` before you can use it.)*

5. Now, [run the deployment](https://github.com/Azure/sap-hana#running-the-deployment) of your HANA single-node instance. You can [verify the installation](https://github.com/Azure/sap-hana#verifying-the-deployment) afterwards.

6. Should you wish to delete your HANA single-node instance at a later point, you can simply [follow the general instructions on the overview page](https://github.com/Azure/sap-hana#deleting-the-deployment).
